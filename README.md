# EvoGenesis

An autonomous, self-evolving intelligent agent kernel framework.

## Vision

EvoGenesis is designed to be an operating system for AI agent teams, with core capabilities for autonomy and self-evolution. It dynamically manages instructions, agents, teams, language models, tools, and memory based on given or self-generated tasks.

## Core Modules

1. **Agent Management**: Handles agent lifecycle and team coordination
2. **Task Planning & Execution**: Translates goals into actionable plans
3. **LLM Orchestration**: Manages language model selection and interaction
4. **Tooling System**: Handles tool lifecycle and execution environments
5. **Memory Management**: Provides short and long-term memory storage
6. **Human-in-the-Loop Interface**: Bridges human users and the system
7. **Self-Evolution Engine**: Manages framework updates and improvements
